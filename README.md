# Train-Switching

This repo describes the project called Train Switching , which enables the user to switch their train in real time to another train coming earlier than the train for which he has bought the ticket . 



# Problem : 
       > This project solves the problem of long waiting queue of people for the delayed train (In our project we have taken the case of Indian Railways but this product can be implemented for any transportation.) . 
       > Passengers hate waiting for delayed train due to any reason .We are trying to reduce this hate by providing an extra facility called " Train Switching"  . 
       > This solution will reduce the amount of people in queue to a certain number .
       
# Our Solution :
        > We are trying to built a application that passengers will use and they will going to check their train status .
        > If their train in " On Time " then it's okay for them . No need to worry .
        > But if the train is late( we have taken consideration for those trains who are atleast late by more than an hour as a threshold value) , the application will show that your train is late . 
        > The app will suggest them the others train which is having the destination as that the user wants to go .
        > This will save the user time of waiting in long queue. 
        > The user will pay extra amount if the price of the ticket is higher in the train than the train he has booked and the booking get confirmed and he will receive a seat no in new train
        
        
        
# Benefits :

        > A phsycological rest will be there in case of dely of train
        > IN Railway will get more passengers as their vacant seats are also get fulfilling
        > It will also reduce the corruption in some extent as TC can't sell the tickets to people for their own profit.
